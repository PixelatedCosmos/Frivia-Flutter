# Frivia

Frivia is a Flutter app that allows users to test their knowledge with a true or false quiz. The app uses the Trivia API to fetch quiz questions based on the user's selected difficulty, number of questions, and genre preferences.

## Features

- Choose quiz difficulty (easy, medium, hard)
- Select the number of questions for the quiz
- Pick a genre for the quiz questions
- True or false quiz format

## API Limitations

Please note that due to limitations on the Trivia API side, the app may not always provide questions that match exactly what the user picks on the menu screen. This is because the API may not have enough questions available for certain combinations of difficulty, number of questions, and genre.
